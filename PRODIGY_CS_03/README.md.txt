## Project 3 - Password Complexity Checker ðŸ”‘

### Description
This tool evaluates the strength of passwords using entropy calculation and other criteria, providing feedback to the user on the strength of their password.

### Features
- **Entropy Calculation**: Measures the randomness of a password.
- **Strength Feedback**: Categorizes passwords as Weak, Fair, Strong, or Very Strong.
