## Project 2 - Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption üñºÔ∏è

### Description
Encrypt and decrypt images by manipulating pixel values. The project implements custom algorithms without relying on existing encryption libraries.

### Features
- **Pixel Manipulation**: Swaps pixel values and applies mathematical operations.
- **Custom GUI**: Includes an interface for entering passwords for encryption and decryption.
- **Enhanced Security**: Uses a custom algorithm for unique encryption.

### Usage
```bash
# Run the script
python image_encryption.py
```

### Requirements
- `Pillow`

### Example
Encrypted images are saved with scrambled pixels, and decrypted images restore the original content.
