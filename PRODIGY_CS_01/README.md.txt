## Project 1 - Caesar Cipher Algorithm ðŸ”’

### Description

The Caesar Cipher Algorithm is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. This project allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the algorithm.

### Features

- **User Input**: Accepts a message and shift value.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Performs both operations based on the shift.
- **Robust for All Inputs**: Handles edge cases effectively.

### Usage

```bash
# Run the script
python caesar_cipher.py
```

### Example

Input: `HELLO` with a shift of `3`

Output: `KHOOR`
